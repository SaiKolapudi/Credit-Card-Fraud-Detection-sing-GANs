Enhancing Credit Card Fraud Detection Using GANs
Course Details
# Course Name:
ADTA 5340 Section 002 - Discovery and Learning with Big Data (Fall 2023 1)

# Professor:
Dr. Leann Boyce

Project Overview
# In this project, Meghana Patibandla, Sai Tulasi Kolapudi, and Rakesh Sarma Karra address the critical challenge of credit card fraud. Utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), our goal is to enhance the detection accuracy of fraud detection systems, contributing to the overall security of financial transactions.
Dataset
# Dataset Link:
Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset 2023

Challenge: Class Imbalance
# The class imbalance in credit card transaction data, where legitimate transactions far outnumber fraudulent ones, presents a significant challenge to accurate fraud detection.
Solution: Augmented Data for Enhanced Security
# To counter the imbalanced data issue, we employed GANs to generate synthetic fraudulent transactions, achieving a balanced dataset. This augmentation not only enriches the training data but also enhances the security of financial systems by improving fraud detection accuracy.
Methodology
# Data Preprocessing:
Initiated with comprehensive data cleaning and standardization.

# GAN Implementation:
Developed GANs to produce synthetic fraudulent transactions, addressing data imbalance.

# Model Training and Evaluation:
Trained various models on the augmented dataset and evaluated them using accuracy, precision, recall, and AUPRC metrics.

Key Findings
# The incorporation of synthetic data generated by GANs was pivotal in enhancing the performance of our fraud detection models, underscoring the value of data augmentation in improving financial transaction security.
Future Directions
# We aim to further our research by applying our models to a broader dataset spectrum and exploring real-time fraud detection integration, with a continued focus on model transparency and explainability.
Team Contributions
# Meghana Patibandla:
